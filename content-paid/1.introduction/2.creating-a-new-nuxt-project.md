# Creating a fresh Nuxt project
You can technically set up a Nuxt project from scratch yourself, and I'll show you how at the end of this post. It is much better and easier to just use their command-line tool `nuxi`, so let us start with that:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi init my-nuxt-project
```
> Just replace 'my-nuxt-project' with your project name.

# Voila!
Now you'll have a new nuxt project with some steps in your cli to install dependencies ✨. Remember to use `pnpm`. As we go along through the course and start coding, you can use that project to follow along with examples. If you are familiar with `git`, make a branch of the fresh project to work on and every time we start on something new, you can just make a new branch off master/main and start fresh!

# Starting a project from scratch
Just for the sake of curiousity, I'll show you how to start a Nuxt project from scratch.

## First initialize a new folder with pnpm

```bash{}[~]
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project && pnpm init
```

The command above uses `mkdir` to create a new folder called 'my-new-project', then it changes directories into that folder with `cd` and finally it initializes the folder (adds a package.json) with `pnpm`. Just follow the steps.

After completing the initialization the project is ready to install Nuxt:

```bash{}[~/my-new-project]
pnpm add -D nuxt@latest
```

After installing Nuxt let's create the following file structure:

```bash{}[~/my-new-project]
| - app.vue
| - nuxt.config.ts
| - public
| - .gitignore
| - pnpm-lock.yaml (should already exist)
| - node_modules (should already exist)
| - package.json (should already exist)
```

Update your `nuxt.config.ts` file with the following:

```typescript{}[~/my-new-project/nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({})
```

Update your `app.vue` file with the following:

```vue{}[~/my-new-project/app.vue]
<template>
  <NuxtWelcome />
<template>
```

Add files to `.gitignore` so it doesn't get committed:

```bash{}[~/my-new-project/.gitignore]
node_modules
*.log*
.nuxt
.nitro
.cache
.output
.env*
```

Update your `package.json` scripts:

```json{}[~/my-new-project/package.json]
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nuxt dev",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "preview": "nuxt preview",
    "generate": "nuxt generate"
  },
  ...
}
```

In later posts, we'll take a deep dive into all these commands, but for now that's it! You've just set up a Nuxt project. Now you can run:

```bash{}[~/my-new-project]
pnpm dev
```

And watch your app go live on [http://localhost:3000].

# Conclusion
Setting up a Nuxt project is trivial! In the next post we'll look at using templates to set up Nuxt projects.
