# The <span class="text-colorful">Nuxt CLI</span> tool deep dive

Nuxt ships with a CLI tool called `nuxi`. So far, we have looked at how we can use it to start new projects with the `init` subcommand. In this article we look at all the other commands that it ships with and how it speeds up a lot of work that we would otherwise be doing manually.

## The `nuxi add` command

When developing with Nuxt we're constantly working on 7 facets of the app:

**Presentation Layer**

- Layouts
- Pages
- Components

**Request Layer**

- Middleware
- API Routes

**Logic Layer**

- Composables
- Plugins

There are other areas of the app too, but these require a certain amount of boiler plate. Let's look at the manual setup of each, so that we can understand what it is that `nuxi` does for us.

### Layouts with the Nuxi command

In an upcoming section, we'll have a deeper look into `.vue` file structures, but essentially a layout can be seen as a reusable `container` for your app's pages and components. In HTML you could imagine a layout as all the stuff around your page's code, for example:

```html{}[index.html]
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Awesome Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav></nav>

    <div id="content">
      <!-- Your content here -->
    </div>

    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example we could look at everything _around_ the content div as a `layout`. It is convenient for us to only create `pages` of content that will be rendered inside the content area and reuse the head, navigation, footer etc. for all pages - perhaps just tweaking the title of the page.

In nuxt that file will exist in `layouts/default.vue`, the naming of these files are significant and Nuxt treats the `default.vue` file as the layout to be used by default (without needing to tell the page what layout to use).

A layout file corresponding to the above would look something like:

```vue{}[layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <main>
    <nav></nav>

    <slot></slot>

    <footer></footer>
  </main>
</template>
```

We'll take a deeper dive into layouts a bit later in this course, but essentially the file above is using a `<slot></slot>` element to mark the area where Nuxt should render your `page` content. The navbar and the footer will render on every page that uses this layout.

As you can imagine, if your application has many different layouts. E.g. one for the auth page, one for the dashboard, one for the landing page etc. writing this boilerplate each time can become tedious. This is where `nuxi` steps in to make life easier - all you need to run is:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add layout dashboard
```

This is saying, add a new layout with the name dashboard. It will then create the `layouts/dashboard.vue` file for you.

### Pages with the Nuxi command

Pages have the same `.vue` file structure as layouts, but they live in `pages/<name>.vue`. Pages are special in that they are automatically mapped to routes in your browser, for example:

```
pages/index.vue           - /
pages/home.vue            - /home
pages/dashboard/index.vue - /dashboard
pages/posts/[id].vue      - /posts/<dynamic-id>
```

We'll take a deeper dive into dynamic paths, but for now just know that the name you give your pages files matter in what the user visits in the browser. Here's an example of a page:

```vue{}[pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

This is the content that would be rendered into the `<slot>` section of your template. To create a new page with the nuxi command, simply do:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add page dashboard
```

This generates `pages/dashboard.vue`. To create a page with a dynamic path:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add page "users/[userId]"
```

This will generate `pages/users/[userId].vue`.

Now that you understand the core thing that nuxi replaces, here's what the files, paths and commands look like for all the other layers. Don't worry we'll have dedicated sections to go more into detail about these files and their code.

### Components with the Nuxi command

_what the file looks like_

```vue{}[components/MyNavigation.vue]
<template>
  <nav>
    <a>
      <img src="logo.png" />
    </a>
  </nav>
</template>
```

_The nuxi command for adding components_

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add component MyNavigation
```

Components accept special modifiers `--client` or `--server`. This is a shortcut to generate a component that should either be rendered on the server or only rendered on the client. We'll look into why there are some components we might not want to render on the server.

### Middleware with the Nuxi command

_what the file looks like_

```typescript{}[middleware/auth.global.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (to.path.match(/^\/protected\/?/)) {
    return navigateTo('/');
  }
});
```

_The nuxi command for adding middleware_

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add middleware --global auth
```

The `--global` modifier is used to tell nuxi to append `.global.ts` to the middleware name. Nuxt runs these types of middlewares on every request. We'll look at the different types of middlewares again later in this course.

### API routes with the Nuxi command

_what the file looks like_

```typescript{}[server/api/user.get.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  return {
    id: 1,
    email: "johndoe@test.com"
  }
});
```

_The nuxi command for adding API routes_

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add api --get user
```

The modifiers for adding API routes are the HTTP verbs that you want to use for the endpoint. e.g. `--post` or `--put`. This will append it to your filename.

### Composables with the Nuxi command

_what the file looks like_

```typescript{}[composables/location.ts]
export const useLocation = () => {}
```

_The nuxi command for adding composables_

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add composable location
```

### Plugins with the Nuxi command

_what the file looks like_

```typescript{}[plugins/firebase.ts]
export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
  // ...
});
```

_The nuxi command for adding plugins_

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi add plugin firebase
```

The Nuxi `add` command is a neat feature of the CLI to help speed up development time a little through writing less boilerplate. Go ahead and practice the command in the Nuxt project we generated earlier.

## The `nuxi prepare` command

This is another command that we will be running intermittently when developing, but haven't started a dev or build yet.

Nuxt ships with a lot of TypeScript goodies and it uses the special `.nuxt` folder for all kinds of generated types. Usually you won't need to run anything because if you run build / dev then Nuxt handles this for you.

There are some cases though where you might be developing without running a build / server and need the typing in your project. Or in CI environments. This is when prepare is helpful:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi prepare
```

Running this within your project root will generate the `.nuxt` directory with all the necessary files and types your app needs. If your app is in a different root folder, e.g. `src`, you can specify that:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi prepare src
```

## The `nuxi upgrade` command

Nuxt is under active development, by an amazing team with crazy velocity. This means that newer versions are still hot off the shelf. An easy way to get the latest version is to use nuxi:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi upgrade
```

## The `nuxi devtools` command

Nuxt has an amazing devtools project that makes debugging and inspecting an ease. To enable / disable devtools in your project:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi devtools enable
```
<br>

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi devtools disable
```

Note, that this installs the devtools globally on your computer and also modifies your `.nuxtrc`.

## The `nuxi cleanup` command

Sometimes when things get a bit complicated, you might want to make sure there aren't any old files interfering with how your code is running. 

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi clean
```

This will delete:

- .nuxt
- .output
- node_modules/.vite
- node_modules/.cache

And restore your project to a fresh state, so you can be sure it is truly just your code that is buggy üòù.

## The build, dev and generate command

For the purpose of this tutorial these will be the last three commands I cover. The other commands that exist I don't feel are very relevant at this stage, but [you can always check them out](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/analyze).

### Nuxi build

The build command does exactly what you think - it will build your application ready for production. We rarely run this manually as it's usually specified in your `package.json` scripts:

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi build
```

You can pass an optional `--dotenv <filename>` flag if your .env is in another file like `.env.local`.

### Nuxi dev

This is the command we run the most when developing our application. Again, mostly via the `scripts` in our `package.json`, it prepares your application in an unoptimized state with Vite and Nitro and enables features like `HMR` so your app updates instantly in the browser as you make changes.

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi dev
```

This command has a [bunch of useful modifiers](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/dev#nuxi-dev) that you can use for e.g. https local server, using different ports, controlling the output in your terminal etc.

### Nuxi generate

Much like _build_ this command also packages your application for production, the main difference is that instead of generating the server endpoints - it will generate the static output of your application which you can host on platforms like Netlify without the need for a server to handle incoming requests to generate the HTML. The HTML is essentially `prerendered` and on the client side the Vue engine is loaded again for interactivity.

We'll take a deep dive into different modes you can run your production app in and build a project using each:

- Server-Side Rendered
- Statically Generated
- Single Page Applications

```bash{}[~]
npx nuxi generate
```

Under the hood, this command basically runs `npx nuxi build` with a special modifier `--prerender`. It crawls all your pages and the `<nuxt-link>` elements on it to find the pages that need to be rendered into the `.output/public` folder. This is the folder that you'll deploy to your static hosting environment.

> This limits your application in some ways with regards to API routes, server middlewares etc.

# Conclusion

The nuxi command is a super tool for productivity and developer experience when developing Nuxt apps. Learning the commands is very helpful and you can always refer back to this page during this course to remember what the commands that we use are doing.
